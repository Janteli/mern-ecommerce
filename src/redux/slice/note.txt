// redux APIs
import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
// for querying action - createAsyncThunk or create action
// differences is -
// createAsyncThunk - to handle Async action eg requesting to 3rd party server
// createAction - to handle asynchronous action


// slice- individual entities - section for what controllers and endpoints are created
// each endpoints are actions
extraReducers and reducers both are to handle actions but difference is extraReducers is to handle async actions and reducers is asynchronous action
// action created has 3 states - pending, fullfilled and rejected
